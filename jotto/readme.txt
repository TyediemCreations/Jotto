'Jotto' is a simple word-guessing game.
A 5-letter word is selected randomly from 'words.txt', and the player is given 10 chances to determine that word.
For each guess made by the player, the player is given the number of direct and indirect letter matches.
The player is given an addition window which can be used to 'cross out' letters the player has reason to believe are not part of the word, as well as record any information they may find helpful (it is in this window that the correct answer is displayed if it is not guessed before the game ends)

Program is accessible via the command 'make run'
